# Fake-news-Detection
This project investigate the analysis and results obtained from the classification of real and fake news with dataset from Kaggle with logistic regression machine learning technique and Term-frequency Inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer, designed to handle categorical data with several performance metrics including model accuracy score, confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, precision and recall as well as receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Results and accuracy score shows a 97% F1 score of proportions of successfully classified news article, 0.97 ROC AUC score showing the high efficacy of the regression model. This shows the high fitness of logistic regression model for binary classification and accuracy of this research.
